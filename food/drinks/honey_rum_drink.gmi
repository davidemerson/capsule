# David's Honey-Rum Drink

I use this to get rid of excess white rum, which I don't really enjoy. Honey and lemon and angostura make it a lot tastier, though, and the rum acts as a very good solvent for all this.

## Ingredients
20mL Honey
20mL Lemon Juice
60mL White Rum
Four dashes Angostura Bitters

## Procedure
Stir all ingredients together to dissolve honey. Add ice, stir for 30s, the strain and serve "up".
