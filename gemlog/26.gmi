# Server Move

Got tired of the bots going after my proxy and into gemini, so I went gemini only.

Running nginx to host my https presence, which basically tells people to get a gemini browser if they want to visit.

For gemini services, I switched things up to satellite, written in Go. It's super simple, and effective.
