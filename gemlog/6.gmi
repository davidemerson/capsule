# Fit the Second: ceci n'est pas une Ã©valuation (du pinephone)

=> https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-a/cortex-a53 This, at 1.2GHz, is the processor in my PinePhone.

The PinePhone has 2GB RAM, or 3GB if you wasted even more money than I did.

It's got 16GB eMMC storage internally, also expandable optionally.

The GeekBench score for this CPU in the 2GB RAM variant, as I have, is 493 single-core, 1292 multi-core.

As a comparison, a Raspberry Pi 4, a respectable BCM2711 implementation of the A72 gets a GeekBench score of around 200 single-core and 650 multi-core.

Also as a comparison, the GeekBench score achieved by the A53 PinePhone is roughly equivalent to the benchmark posted by an Intel Xeon L3426 quad-core processor from about 2009. This is not bad at all, especially considering the L3426 consumes, while the A53 consumes, in this configuration, less than one watt.

The comparison isn't perfect, but it's at least a context for my first assertion:

We live in a time of unprecedented hardware availability. Our mass-produced chipsets are objectively fast, very efficient, and very inexpensive. I can buy a phone for $149 today which benchmarks about as well as a single-socket server from 2009, and doesn't melt in my hand. Despite this trend, we have failed to harness that power with meaningfully more-functional software.
