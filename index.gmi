## Gemini?
=> https://suckless.org/sucks/web/ Because content should be the primary concern.

If you want your own setup, I've got some GitHub repos here with containers and configurations you can repurpose:
=> https://github.com/davidemerson/nnix.com-gemini Agate Gemini Server in a container.
=> https://github.com/davidemerson/nnix.com-kineto Kineto Gemini-to-HTTP proxy in a container.
=> https://github.com/davidemerson/nnix.com-www NGINX container that proxies Kineto to the HTTP edge, does SSL, and a bunch of redirects for me.
=> https://github.com/davidemerson/capsule The static content for this site.

"The original MIX computer ran fine without 
an operating system. You could bootstrap it 
with punched cards or paper tape and do 
everything yourself. But nowadays such power 
is no longer in the hands of ordinary users. 
The MMIX hardware, like all other computing 
machines made today, relies on an operating 
system to get jobs started in their own 
address spaces and to provide I/O capabilities.

Whenever anybody has asked if I will be 
writing a book about operating systems, my 
reply has always been 'Nix.' Therefore the 
name of MMIX's operating system, NNIX, should 
come as no surprise.

From time to time I will necessarily have to 
refer to things that NNIX does for its users, 
but I have no intention of building NNIX myself. 
Life is too short. It would be wonderful if 
some expert in operating system design became 
inspired to write a book that explains exactly 
how to construct a nice, clean NNIX kernel for 
an MMIX chip. The MMIX fascicle includes a 
level-50 exercise that asks a highly motivated 
reader to 'Write a book about operating systems, 
which includes a complete design of an NNIX 
kernel for the MMIX architecture.' Other 
alternatives are also possible; for example, 
somebody at the Free Software Foundation might 
decide to come up with an alternative system 
called GNNIX."
