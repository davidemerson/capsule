## Intro

Hey all, I'm DJ VOLE, and it's the week-end. I do this show because I like to close out my work day Friday with some chill music, and there's little reason not to share that with you all at the same time.

Today we've got some Moody Blues, Dave Rawlings Machine, Mulatu Astatke, The Flaming Lips, Father John Misty, Broken Bells, eevee, Moderator, Belle & Sebastian, Gaudi, Ash Walker, and The Felice Brothers.

Track listings and transcripts are available at nnix.com, that's November November India x-ray .com, hosted on both https and gemini protocols.

Let's get down to business. Grab a drink, and put on the good headphones. Happy Friday!
